# SpongeBobNFTPants

SpongeBobNFTPants is the work carried out following the amazing course by [_buildspace](https://buildspace.so/) "Mint your own NFT collection and ship a Web3 app to show them off".

In the "Contract" directory you can find all the code being deployed to the blockchain. In the "WebApp" directory you can find the code for the react web app which allows users to interact with the contract and mint their own NFTs!
