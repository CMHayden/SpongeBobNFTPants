# SpongeBobNFTPants

This was originally forked from the demo application from the guys over at [_buildspace](https://buildspace.so/) who created the amazing course that taught me how to do all this! If you're interested in learning about dev3 I cannot recommend them enough! 

A live version can be found [on replit](https://nft-starter-repo-final.cmhayden.repl.co/).
